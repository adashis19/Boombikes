# Project Name
> To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Dataset consisted of 730 rows and 11 columns
- Sequential steps of Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Preparation, Model Prep Processing, Model Building, Residual Analysis and Model Prediction were done

## Modelling Approach Used
- Mix approach of All Features model with feature deletion, and evaluating against Recursive Feature Elimination Method

## Conclusions
- Training set achieved an adjusted R*2 of 0.82
- The Model predicted 79% of the variation on test set
- 3 key features according to the model were atemp, weathersit_3 and yr
